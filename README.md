## Literature Review Summary

Ontario's electricity infrastructure is undergoing a significant transformation with the increasing deployment of Smart Grids, aiming to enhance efficiency, reliability, and renewable integration. Despite the technological advancements, the province currently lacks a zonal-level readiness evaluation framework to guide strategic investment decisions. Shraddha Padwekar's research addresses this gap by proposing a Smart Grid Readiness Index (SGRI) derived from operational indicators such as demand variability, price volatility, dispatch deviation, and outage frequency. This approach is informed by prior studies that employ machine learning, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) models, and reliability assessments but uniquely integrates these components at the zonal level using real-time data from the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO). Her work is distinguished by its granularity, empirical rigor, and reproducibility using publicly available datasets.

While related literature has explored individual indicators—such as AHP-based investment scoring (Dincer et al., 2025), reliability metrics (Ethirajan et al., 2025), and dispatch analysis (Gaggero et al., 2025)—no study to date has consolidated them into a single composite index tailored to Ontario’s zoning framework. By employing a Weighted Scoring Model (WSM) and optionally refining the weights using AHP, Shraddha’s methodology facilitates actionable ranking of Smart Grid readiness across Ontario’s zones. The datasets used—spanning real-time demand, zonal pricing, dispatch logs, and outage records—are all openly licensed and CSV-formatted, supporting a robust pipeline for preprocessing, metric computation, and visualization. This research thus contributes a scalable tool for policymakers and utility stakeholders, capable of guiding data-driven Smart Grid funding allocations.
